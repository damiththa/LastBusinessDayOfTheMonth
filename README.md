LastBusinessDayOfTheMonth
=========================

I know it is confusing but this is something I have to accomplish recently. But if you really think about it, it’s very useful in many in-office applications.  Anyhow, after ample internet reading and searching, I finally figured it out  Here is how I did it. I’m sure there are plenty of ways of doing this, but to save you with the trouble I’m posting it. Feel free to use and and please comments thoughts, suggestions, etc.  And BTW, this snippet finds the Last Business Day of the month. With little bit of tweaking, it’s easy to find the first business day of next month. (I actually had to find both, in two different occurrences.) (Let me know if you want that)  Here we go,  Before we get into coding here is a scenario to think about. Let’s say we found what’s the last business day of the month, but what if that’s a company holiday…. aha problemo isn’t it? Not so much, if we factor that in to coding.  Now-a-days almost every company has a table of company holidays. This is usually managed by HR dept. and this list contains company holidays as well as national holidays.  Oh BTW, when this is running I made it pop up a cfwindow saying ‘today is the last business day of this month, do whatcha gotta do’
